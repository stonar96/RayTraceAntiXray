#       # RayTraceAntiXray hides blocks that are exposed to air, which are not hidden by Paper Anti-Xray.
#       # For this, a list of block positions is created when a chunk is sent to a player based on the block selection related settings below.
#       # Those blocks are hidden initally when the chunk is sent, which means they are replaced by stone, deepslate, netherrack or end stone depending on the world type.
#       # Then they are ray traced to reveal the blocks that the player can actually see.
#       ray-trace: true                         # Whether or not to enable ray tracing. Note that Paper Anti-Xray must also be enabled using engine-mode: 1.
#       ray-trace-third-person: true            # Whether or not to ray trace third person back and front view. Note that this is even more resource intensive.
#       ray-trace-distance: 64.0                # Blocks with a greater distance between the block center and the player eye are not calculated and will thus stay hidden or revealed depending on the previous state.
#       rehide-blocks: true                     # Whether or not to rehide revealed blocks that the player can no longer see. If false, revealed (already seen) blocks are only rehidden when the chunk is resent.
#       rehide-distance: 60.0                   # Blocks with a greater or equal distance between the block center and the player eye are treated as invisible to the player and are therefore (re)hidden (provided that rehide-blocks is enabled and the distance is still within the ray-trace-distance). If rehide-blocks is disabled, this setting has a similar effect as the ray-trace-distance and no effect if it is greater than the ray-trace-distance.
#       ### Block selection related settings ###
#       # The following settings are used to determine the list of block positions to be hidden and ray traced when a chunk is sent to a player.
#       # Note that this list is not updated dynamically with newly placed or broken blocks until the chunk is resent.
#       # Note that Paper Anti-Xray config settings, such as max-block-height, also apply.
#       max-ray-trace-block-count-per-chunk: 30 # Maximum number of initially hidden and ray traced block positions per chunk. Counting starts at the bottom of the world and increases upwards.
#       ray-trace-blocks:                       # Blocks that are hidden and ray traced. If this list is empty, the hidden-blocks specified in the Paper config file are used.

#   lobby:                                      # Example section for the world lobby. Missing settings are inherited from the default section.

#       ray-trace: false                        # Disable ray tracing in the world lobby.
